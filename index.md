## Components

Digital Caviar Solutions houses tools developed by Christophe Van
Neste and collaborators. The main focus is open source software for
medical research and translational applications.

The core packages for bioinformatics are:

- [genairics](https://github.com/dicaso/genairics): raw data analysis
- [bidali](https://github.com/dicaso/bidali): advanced processing and biological inference
- [pyni](https://github.com/dicaso/pyni): network inference package
- [leopard](https://github.com/dicaso/leopard): lab reporting package

A graphical user interface is under way, coined [pycassos](https://github.com/dicaso/pycassos).
For more information, see the [dicaso](https://github.com/dicaso github organization page.

### Open source projects

This project would not have been possible if it could not rely on the work of many
other open source projects. It would be too many to list here, but they can be found
by looking at the `setup.py` files of the different dicaso tools.
